# Midnight app in React.js

App visualizes data from public API, https://docs.coincap.io/. We can search any asset by name using Search Bar, and additionally we can load a chart from last 24 hours using the button in the top right corner. Loading charts will generate API request to historical data and display it in every asset component.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
